# Hop 4: BuffRegistry (Positive Effects) - COMPLETED âœ…

## Summary
Successfully implemented the BuffRegistry system for managing stat modification effects in the Broken Divinity prototype. This completes Hop 4 of the development roadmap with full integration testing and workflow improvements.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. BuffRegistry Implementation
- **File**: `src/game/buff_registry.py`
- **Purpose**: Registry for buff effects (positive stat modifications) extending BaseRegistry pattern
- **Features**:
  - Buff dataclass with stat_modifiers, duration, stacking, and permanent/temporary types
  - JSON-based data loading from `data/buffs/` directory  
  - Signal bus integration for registry events
  - Specialized query methods for filtering by type and stat
  - Stat calculation methods with stacking support

### 2. Buff Data Files
- **Location**: `data/buffs/*.json`
- **Count**: 5 buff effects implemented
- **Buffs**:
  - **Rage**: +5 attack, -2 defense (3 turns, stacks to 2)
  - **Shield Wall**: +8 defense, -3 speed (5 turns, single stack)
  - **Combat Focus**: +3 speed, +2 accuracy (4 turns, stacks to 3)
  - **Combat Training**: +2 attack, +1 defense (permanent)
  - **Divine Blessing**: +1 all stats, +5 health (10 turns, single stack)

### 3. Comprehensive Testing
- **File**: `tests/test_buff_registry.py`
- **Coverage**: 14 test methods
- **Tests**: Registry initialization, dataclass validation, JSON loading, stacking calculations, signal emission, permanent vs temporary buffs
- **Result**: All tests passing âœ…

### 4. Enhanced Game Launcher
- **Enhancement**: Updated `src/main.py` to test both StateRegistry and BuffRegistry
- **Integration**: Automatic validation of all registries on game boot
- **Display**: Shows current systems status and next hop target
- **Validation**: Verifies expected items exist and registries load correctly

### 5. Workflow Improvements Applied
- **Test-First Development**: All tests written before implementation
- **Real Signal Testing**: Used actual signal bus instead of mocking for integration tests
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Comprehensive workflow improvement tracking
- **Game Launch Validation**: Automatic registry testing on every game boot

## Technical Details

### Buff Dataclass
```python
@dataclass
class Buff:
    id: str
    name: str 
    description: str
    stat_modifiers: Dict[str, int] = field(default_factory=dict)
    default_duration: int = 1
    max_stacks: int = 1
    buff_type: str = "temporary"  # "temporary" or "permanent"
    is_permanent: bool = False
    
    def calculate_total_modifiers(self, stack_count: int) -> Dict[str, int]
    def can_stack_to(self, target_stacks: int) -> bool
```

### Registry Features
- Extends `BaseRegistry[Buff]`
- Automatic JSON loading from data directory
- Signal emission on initialization and errors
- Thread-safe operations with locking
- Specialized query methods for buff filtering

### JSON Data Schema
```json
{
    "id": "buff_id",
    "name": "Display Name",
    "description": "Buff description", 
    "stat_modifiers": {"attack": 5, "defense": -2},
    "default_duration": 3,
    "max_stacks": 2,
    "buff_type": "temporary"
}
```

## Test Results
- **Total Tests**: 84 (all modules)
- **BuffRegistry Tests**: 14/14 passing
- **Overall Status**: All tests passing âœ…
- **Coverage**: Full functionality coverage including edge cases

## Integration Success
- **StateRegistry**: âœ… 5 status effects (stun, bleed, poison, slow, haste)
- **BuffRegistry**: âœ… 5 buff effects (rage, shield_wall, combat_focus, combat_training, blessing)
- **Signal Bus**: âœ… Both registries communicate via signals
- **Game Launcher**: âœ… Validates both registries automatically

## Next Steps
With Hop 4 complete, the project is ready for:
- **Hop 5**: EntityRegistry (creatures & stats)
- **Hop 6**: AbilityRegistry (JSON-driven abilities)
- **Hop 7**: SuffixRegistry (procedural generation)

## Files Modified/Created
- âœ… `src/game/buff_registry.py` - New BuffRegistry implementation
- âœ… `data/buffs/*.json` - 5 buff effect definitions  
- âœ… `tests/test_buff_registry.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- âœ… `src/main.py` - Enhanced with BuffRegistry testing
- âœ… `ROADMAP.md` - Updated to mark Hop 4 complete
- âœ… `systemupkeep.md` - Documented BuffRegistry APIs and workflow improvements

## Success Criteria Met
- [x] BuffRegistry manages all positive effects
- [x] Stacking calculations accurate
- [x] Signal communication working (separate from StateRegistry)
- [x] Integration tests with StateRegistry pass
- [x] All tests passing (84/84)
- [x] Game launches successfully with both registries
- [x] Workflow improvements documented and applied

## Workflow Improvements Identified
- âœ… Test-first development approach highly effective
- âœ… Real signal bus testing better than mocking for integration
- âœ… Enhanced game launcher validates registries automatically
- âœ… BaseRegistry pattern enables rapid registry development
- âœ… Individual JSON file approach scales well for content

**Hop 4 Status: COMPLETE** ðŸŽ‰

**Ready for Hop 5: EntityRegistry (Creatures & Stats)**
