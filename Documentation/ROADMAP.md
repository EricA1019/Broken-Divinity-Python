# Broken Divinity - Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development progression for the ASCII roguelike version of Broken Divinity, organized into discrete "hops" following the Close-to-Shore methodology.

## üéØ Development Philosophy

Each hop represents a complete, testable feature that:
- ‚úÖ Has green tests
- ‚úÖ Produces a bootable prototype
- ‚úÖ Includes verbose logging with system tags
- ‚úÖ Follows data-driven principles
- ‚úÖ Ends with a clean commit

## üìã Phase 1: Foundation

### Core Infrastructure
- [x] **Hop 1**: Project Scaffold - VS Code workspace, dependencies, folder structure
- [ ] **Hop 2**: Minimal tcod Window - Black console with ESC handling
- [ ] **Hop 3**: Screen Layout Framework - 4-region console layout with borders
- [ ] **Hop 4**: Basic Entity Data Model - JSON entity loader with registry
- [ ] **Hop 5**: Prefix/Suffix Variant System - Entity modifiers with merge algorithm
- [ ] **Hop 6**: Action State Machine - Root menu with F/D/I/A key handling
- [ ] **Hop 7**: Combat Log System - Scrollable message history

### World Generation
- [ ] **Hop 8**: Simple Room Generator - Single rectangular room with walls/floor
- [ ] **Hop 9**: Multi-Room Dungeon - Connected rooms with corridors
- [ ] **Hop 10**: Player Movement - @ character movement with collision
- [ ] **Hop 11**: Enemy Placement - Random enemy spawning in rooms
- [ ] **Hop 12**: Field of View - tcod FOV with explored/visible states
- [ ] **Hop 13**: Room Event System - Combat/treasure/empty room triggers
- [ ] **Hop 14**: Turn-Based Time - Speed-based priority queue scheduler

### Combat System
- [ ] **Hop 15**: Basic Combat Initiation - Enemy collision starts combat mode
- [ ] **Hop 16**: Attack Resolution - Damage calculation and HP tracking
- [ ] **Hop 17**: Ability System Core - JSON abilities with effects and costs
- [ ] **Hop 18**: Buff/Debuff Framework - Temporary stat modifications
- [ ] **Hop 19**: Enemy AI Basic - Pathfinding and ability usage
- [ ] **Hop 20**: Death and Respawn - Permadeath with detective immunity
- [ ] **Hop 21**: Victory Conditions - Room/floor completion tracking

### Polish & Integration
- [ ] **Hop 22**: Inventory System - Item collection and usage
- [ ] **Hop 23**: Ability Menu - Asciimatics ability selection interface
- [ ] **Hop 24**: Save/Load Framework - JSON state persistence
- [ ] **Hop 25**: Settings System - YAML/TOML configuration
- [ ] **Hop 26**: Advanced Variants - Complex modifier combinations
- [ ] **Hop 27**: Polish Pass - Visual improvements and feedback
- [ ] **Hop 28**: Full Integration Test - End-to-end testing and validation

## üîß Technical Milestones

### Core Systems
- **Entity Registry**: JSON-driven entity loading with variant support
- **Combat Engine**: Turn-based resolution with abilities and effects
